FROM nginx:latest

# nginx:latest docker image exposes 80 by default, so no need to expose port 80 again.
# Some Paas providers (Back4app) only allow one exposed port, and it has to be port 80.
# Some Paas providers (Codesandbox) prohibit listening on port 80, in such case, use port 8080 instead and
#  delete these lines from nginx.conf: "listen 80;" and "listen [::]:80;"
